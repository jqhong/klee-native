TODO
--
implement a basic strtol for my own sanity and inner peace
    - expand this template for other libc hooks
    - add a thing for delayed constraint additions on the
      original memory region

create a new ABI template that is akin to libc function interception
    - follow regular sycall calling conventions
    - handle functions with variadic args and `rax`

implement new shadow memory mapping for mallocs and free that
follows its own allocation spec. 
    - update writes and reads to check for "special bytes"
    - come up with special byte spec

probably should expand out some more emulated system calls 

check slack and add the libc functions pag was talking about earlier 
after malloc and free work nicely
